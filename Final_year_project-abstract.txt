### **Project Title:**
**Foolproof Frames: Advanced Detection of Manipulated Images**

### **Abstract:**
The rapid evolution of deepfake technology has significantly enhanced the ability to create hyper-realistic fake images, posing a major threat to the credibility of visual media. These manipulated images can lead to misinformation and have far-reaching consequences in political, social, and individual contexts. Current detection systems are limited in their ability to generalize across the vast array of deepfake techniques and alterations. This project aims to develop an advanced deepfake detection system capable of identifying and flagging manipulated images across various use cases. The system is designed to improve the robustness and accuracy of deepfake detection by leveraging machine learning techniques, ensuring adaptability to emerging deepfake methods. This detection tool will be crucial for applications in journalism, social media, cybersecurity, and legal settings, where the integrity of visual media is essential.
